# Predictive Software with Actor-Based Architecture

## Description

This predictive software is designed for processing large volumes of data in reduced timeframes, with a near real-time objective. It utilizes an **actor-based model** architecture, enabling a high level of parallelism and distribution of responsibilities among various system components.

### Key Features:
- **Near Real-Time Processing:** The system is designed to process data much faster than traditional batch systems.
- **Actor Model Architecture:** Synchronization and parallelism between components through a distributed actor model.
- **External Frameworks:** Integration with specialized frameworks for distributed parallel computing to accelerate analysis processes.
- **Message Brokering:** Advanced orchestration and communication system between components to ensure efficient message management.
- **Distributed Storage:** Utilizes distributed storage solutions to ensure resilience and reliability in data management.
